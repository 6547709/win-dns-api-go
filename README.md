# Windows DNS API (GoLang)
===========

This is a simple API based on the [Win DNS API (Node. JS)](https://github.com/vmadman/win-dns-api). It has been rewritten in GoLang mainly for learning purpose and because it seemed more appropriate for this scenario.
This tool acts as an API for Windows Server DNS. With this it is possible to create/edit/delete DNS entries on a Windows Server.
To run this as a service take a look at [NSSM](http://nssm.cc/)

This README will be updated as the project grows. Any contributions are welcomed!
