# Windows DNS API (GoLang)
===========

This is a simple API based on the [Win DNS API (Node. JS)](https://github.com/vmadman/win-dns-api). It has been rewritten in GoLang mainly for learning purpose and because it seemed more appropriate for this scenario.

This README will be updated as the project grows. Any contributions are welcomed!
